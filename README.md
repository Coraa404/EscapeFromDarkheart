# EscapeFromDarkheart
A text-based RPG I created for a University Project

‘Escape from Prison Darkheart’ is a text-based roleplaying game with a low barrier for entry, comprehensive input system with decent forgiveness in terms of inputs, and an entire help page to assist people with accessing the game, anybody can play this game. Players have been stripped of almost all of their senses, being forced to rely on text outputs, which has been done to stimulate the player’s imagination while playing. This game challenges players to navigate a mysterious and hostile environment through exploration deductive reasoning, and player choice, using a limited amount of items to get through each dynamically-changing level and unpredictable interaction. From a development perspective, the project required consideration of legal, ethical, and professional issues. All art and assets were acquired under licenses or were completely original.
The game was primarily developed for academic and educational purposes, and serves as a technical and creative exercise in design and gameplay loop.

BACKGROUND:
Until about 3 months ago, the Prison Darkheart was used to hold prisoners for any number of crimes. Arson, theft, murder, grand larceny, and more. Since then, the prison has been under the siege of a dragon rebellion. It is unknown to you why a dragon siege has befell this prison specifically, given that you have been held here for the last few years with no connection to the outside. Most prisoners have been evacuated by now to other prisons in other countries, and everyone else has fled. Before leaving, the guards gave you and some other prisoners some basic equipment to get by: 3x health potions and 1x sword.
Yesterday, the dragons succeeded in their siege, breaking down the prison and causing it to be abandoned by the people who once protected it. The only people that are left in here are some unfortunare souls that have been under the misfortune to not be evactuated in time, and some dragons who have made it inside the walls. Your job is to escape the prison, and earn your freedom.
